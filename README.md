The sections below detail how to use the scripts. This scripts are created fast
and don't handle error cases only happy cases. Feel free to update any unforeseen
use cases.

## Fummy

Fummy is a script that helps delete branches in git repos. Normally after pushing
and merging branches to master you leave a lot of unused branches in your repositories.

`` -b or --branch states the branches to exclude
 -p or --path states the path to the repo folder
 -t or --threshold the number of days a branch needs to be unused to be considered stale``


Example:

``` python
python fummy.py fummy -b master -p /path/to/Repo/savannah/emr-backend
```
